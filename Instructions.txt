Support multiple rovers at once
Each rover has an id to distinguish them
Build against rspec, then add cli, then add api

Let's break down the problem:
1. What are the ways I could find to support multiple rovers.
Classes, hashes, arrays, Global Variables, Function Arguments, File-based Storage (JSON/YAML) & Database (SQLite)

I am choosing arrays methodolopgy & learning the basics of the same.
